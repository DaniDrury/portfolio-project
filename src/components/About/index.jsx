        <p>Hi! I'm Dani, a junior fullstack web developer and recent UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp grad.</p>
        <p>I delight in creating user-friendly, practical, and performant web applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, HTMX, MySQL, MongoDB, and most recently, React!</p>
        <p>In addition to web applications, I build maintainable personal websites for individuals and small businesses through platforms such as WordPress and Wix. Please send me a message if you are interested in discussing your personal webiste needs!</p>
        <p />
        <p>I look forward to continue building my skills within this fast-paced and ever evolving industry. Additional languages and technologies I am currently studying are Python and cloud services (AWS, Azure).</p>
        <p>If you are interested in collaborating on a project or learning more about me and my work, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
